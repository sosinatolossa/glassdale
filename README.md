# Glassdale PD

## A Nashville Software School JS/CSS/HTML
This project is intended to reinforce the fundamentals of modularizing a web application, utilizing external and custom APIs, fetch API, event-driven decoupled module communication, and DOM manipulation.

The conceit of the project is that we have been hired by a fictional police department to develop a web application to assist their detectives with an investigation. From [an external API resource](http://criminals.glassdale.us), we fetched lists of criminals, convictions, facilities, witnesses, etc. and combined and filtered them as needed. We also added a note-taking component that timestamps the notes associated with particular criminals, using a custom API served with JSON-server.

By the end of the project, I feel that I have gained a strong understanding of the above principles, as well as diving into database structure and relationships.
